### Theme: 
[[The East]]
### Passage:
> [!Bible]+ [Psalm 103:12 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/19/103/)
>  <sup> **12** </sup>as far as the east is from the west,<br/>so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
 %% %%

### Notes
This verse makes even more sense when combined with this theme. Not only can you travel east or west forever without it becoming a different direction, but being cast out from The [[Garden of Eden]] in the west into the east because of our [[sin]], means that our sin is being wiped away so that it is as if [[The Fall]] didnâ€™t even happen!
