### Note:
I wonder if there is a connection with the story of Ishmael and [[Mephibosheth]]. Ishmael is the potential heir to his father's kingdom as the firstborn but it is given to his brother Isaac instead. His mother flees in fear of her life but is then allowed to live within Abraham's family. Mephibosheth, the heir to the throne of Saul, flees for his life with his nursemaid and is dropped. Then he is welcomed into the home of the king to live.
