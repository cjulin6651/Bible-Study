The [[olive tree]] represents [[peace]]. The dove bringing a fresh olive leaf is symbolic of God making peace with man after the judgment has passed.

The olive tree also represents the Holy Spirit. Olive oil was used in the sacrificial system as the carrier for the spices in the holy anointing oil which was used to make things [[Holy]].

Whenever the Holy Spirit’s presence comes upon someone in the New Testament it is described as an anointing. 
> [!Bible]- [Luke 4:18 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/42/4/) [[Luke]] [[Luke4]]
>  <sup> **18** </sup>“The Spirit of the Lord is on me,<br/>because he has anointed me<br/>to preach good news to the poor.<br/>He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners<br/>and recovery of sight for the blind,<br/>to release the oppressed

> [!Bible]- [Acts 10:38 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/44/10/) [[Acts]] [[Acts10]]
>  <sup> **38** </sup>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.

The process by which olives are beaten and crushed to produce olive oil contains spiritual significance as well.

Jesus Christ was beaten and crushed on the cross so that His Holy Spirit would be poured out on the church after His ascension to heaven.

In essence, Jesus Christ is God’s olive tree, and the Holy Spirit, His olive oil.

It is not mere coincidence that Christ’s agonized prayer, just before His arrest, occured in [[Gethsemane]], a place of many olive trees and whose name means “olive press.”
