Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!” <sup> **20** </sup>Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had.

### Notes
This chapter changes up the theme a little. Abram is afraid for his life and so he doesn't trust God. He causes the seeing and taking but does not do it himself, even though his lack of faith is the focus of the story.

It is the first story we get about Abraham and it is a failure account. 

Pharaoh *sees* Sarai and her beauty and *takes* her for himself. 
> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 12:15 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/12/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis12]]
>  <sup> **15** </sup>And when Pharaoh’s officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace.

Seeing and taking leads to a curse/[[Plague]] to befall Pharaoh's household, foreshadowing the plagues of [[Exodus]]. Just as with the Exodus account Pharaoh sends Abraham away as a result of the plagues.
