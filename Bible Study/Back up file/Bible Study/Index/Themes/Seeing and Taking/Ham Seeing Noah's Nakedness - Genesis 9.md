### Passage:
> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 9:20-23 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/9/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis9]]
>  <sup> **20** </sup>Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard. <sup> **21** </sup>When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent. <sup> **22** </sup>Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father’s nakedness and told his two brothers outside. <sup> **23** </sup>But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward and covered their father’s nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father’s nakedness.
 %% %%

### Notes
Ham SEES Noah's nakedness in the fall account. We don't know what happened, but it is contrasted by his sons intentionally NOT Seeing Noah's nakedness and covering him.
