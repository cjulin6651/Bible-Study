### Passage:
> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 3:1-7 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/3/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis3]]
>  <sup> **1** </sup>The Fall of Man<br/>Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?” <sup> **2** </sup>The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, <sup> **3** </sup>but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’” <sup> **4** </sup>“You will not surely die,” the serpent said to the woman. <sup> **5** </sup>“For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” <sup> **6** </sup>When the woman **saw** that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, **she took** some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. <sup> **7** </sup>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.

### Notes
The Serpent deceives Eve that what God has in mind is not in her best interest and that she should disobey him. She SEES the fruit and thinks that it is good so she TAKES it. What humans see and declare good enough to take is not actually what is good for them because they take God from the equation.

The consequence is that they wind up with their eyes opened and they see their nakedness.
