### Passage:
> [!Bible]- [Genesis 8:16-19 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/8/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis8]]
>  <sup> **16** </sup>“Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives. <sup> **17** </sup>Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you—the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground—so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number upon it.” <sup> **18** </sup>So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives. <sup> **19** </sup>All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds—everything that moves on the earth—came out of the ark, one kind after another.

### Notes
[[God]] instructs Noah to leave the ark onto the “new” earth. he uses the same general language and command to describe the creatures of the earth as in Genesis 1:
> [!Bible]- [Genesis 1:20-26 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/1/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis1]]
>  <sup> **20** </sup>And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.” <sup> **21** </sup>So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. <sup> **22** </sup>God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” <sup> **23** </sup>And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day. <sup> **24** </sup>And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so. <sup> **25** </sup>God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup> **26** </sup>Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”
