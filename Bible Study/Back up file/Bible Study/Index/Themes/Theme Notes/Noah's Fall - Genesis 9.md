### Passage:
> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 9:20-27 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/9/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis9]]
>  <sup> **20** </sup>Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard. <sup> **21** </sup>When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent. <sup> **22** </sup>Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father’s nakedness and told his two brothers outside. <sup> **23** </sup>But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward and covered their father’s nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father’s nakedness. <sup> **24** </sup>When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him, <sup> **25** </sup>he said,<br/>“Cursed be Canaan!<br/>The lowest of slaves<br/>will he be to his brothers.” <sup> **26** </sup>He also said,<br/>“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem!<br/>May Canaan be the slave of Shem. <sup> **27** </sup>May God extend the territory of Japheth;<br/>may Japheth live in the tents of Shem,<br/>and may Canaan be his slave.”
 %% %%

### Notes
Noah plants a [[vinyard]] (The word [[kerem]] also translates to "[[garden]]"). That vineyard produces fruit which he makes into [[wine]] and gets drunk with. Just like [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] sinned with a [[fruit]] from the [[Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil]] planted in a Garden, so Noah sins with fruit of the vine.

In his [[sin]], he winds up [[naked]], just as Adam and Eve's sin reveals their own nakedness. Adam and Eve's sin leads to them needing a covering for their nakedness. In the same way, Shem and Japheth cover their father with a cloak.

Ham, is the one who discovers Noah naked and it is unclear if he just made fun of his dad to his brothers or if more was going on. This continues the theme that starts with the fall of [[seeing something]]. Just as Eve "saw that the fruit was good" in Genesis 3.

> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 3:6 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/3/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis3]]
>  <sup> **6** </sup>When the woman **saw** that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.
 %% %%

In the same way, Ham "saw the nakedness", but his brothers walked in backwards  so. "that they did not see their father's nakedness." 

> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 9:23 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/9/)
>  <sup> **23** </sup>But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward and covered their father’s nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father’s nakedness.
 %% %%

In the same way that [[The Fall]] leads to the [[Curse]] for Adam and Eve, Noah curses Ham. Adam and Eve's curse leads to being a slave to sin and the ground, Ham's curse leads him to become a slave to his brothers.

> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 9:25 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/9/)
>  <sup> **25** </sup>he said,<br/>“Cursed be Canaan!<br/>The lowest of slaves<br/>will he be to his brothers.”
 %% %%

Unlike in the [[Genesis3]] Fall narrative, this curse is accompanied by a blessing to Shem and Japheth. 

> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 9:26-27 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/9/)
>  <sup> **26** </sup>He also said,<br/>“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem!<br/>May Canaan be the slave of Shem. <sup> **27** </sup>May God extend the territory of Japheth;<br/>may Japheth live in the tents of Shem,<br/>and may Canaan be his slave.”
 %% %%
