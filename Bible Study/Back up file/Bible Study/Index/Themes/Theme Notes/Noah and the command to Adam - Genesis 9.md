[[Noah]]

### Passage:
> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 9:1-7 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/9/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis9]]
>  <sup> **1** </sup>God’s Covenant With Noah<br/>Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth. <sup> **2** </sup>The fear and dread of you will fall upon all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air, upon every creature that moves along the ground, and upon all the fish of the sea; they are given into your hands. <sup> **3** </sup>Everything that lives and moves will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything. <sup> **4** </sup>“But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it. <sup> **5** </sup>And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each man, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of his fellow man. <sup> **6** </sup>“Whoever sheds the blood of man,<br/>by man shall his blood be shed;<br/>for in the image of God<br/>has God made man. <sup> **7** </sup>As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it.”

### Notes
God’s command to Noah and his family parallels God’s command to Adam in 
> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 1:27-30 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/1/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis1]]
>  <sup> **27** </sup>So God created man in his own image,<br/>in the image of God he created him;<br/>male and female he created them. <sup> **28** </sup>God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.” <sup> **29** </sup>Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. <sup> **30** </sup>And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so.

In this command, God adds a part about not shedding human blood. Probably a callback to [[Cain]] killing [[Abel]]
