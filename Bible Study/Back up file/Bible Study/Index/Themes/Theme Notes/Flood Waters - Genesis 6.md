[[Noah]]

### Passage:
> [!Bible]- [Genesis 6:17 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/6/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis6]]
>  <sup> **17** </sup>I am going to bring **floodwaters** on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish.

### Notes
Manâ€™s sin gets out of control and leads to the ordered waters of creation from [[Genesis1]] to flood and destroy the church. God saves a [[Remnant]] and saves Noah and his family by building an [[Ark]].
