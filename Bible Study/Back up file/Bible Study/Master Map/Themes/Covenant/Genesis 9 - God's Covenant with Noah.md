Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. <sup> **16** </sup>Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.” <sup> **17** </sup>So God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth.”

### Notes
God forms the first covenant in scripture with Noah and all the animals. It is a one-sided covenant that he will not flood the earth again
