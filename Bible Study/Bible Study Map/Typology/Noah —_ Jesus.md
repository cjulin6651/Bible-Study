> [!Bible]- [Genesis 6:1-22 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/6/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis6]]
>  <sup> **1** </sup>The Flood<br/>When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, <sup> **2** </sup>the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. <sup> **3** </sup>Then the Lord said, “My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days will be a hundred and twenty years.” <sup> **4** </sup>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown. <sup> **5** </sup>The Lord saw how great man’s wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time. <sup> **6** </sup>The Lord was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain. <sup> **7** </sup>So the Lord said, “I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth—men and animals, and creatures that move along the ground, and birds of the air—for I am grieved that I have made them.” <sup> **8** </sup>But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord. <sup> **9** </sup>This is the account of Noah.<br/>Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked with God. <sup> **10** </sup>Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. <sup> **11** </sup>Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence. <sup> **12** </sup>God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. <sup> **13** </sup>So God said to Noah, “I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. <sup> **14** </sup>So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. <sup> **15** </sup>This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high. <sup> **16** </sup>Make a roof for it and finish the ark to within 18 inches of the top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks. <sup> **17** </sup>I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. <sup> **18** </sup>But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you. <sup> **19** </sup>You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. <sup> **20** </sup>Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. <sup> **21** </sup>You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.” <sup> **22** </sup>Noah did everything just as God commanded him.

> [!Bible]- [Genesis 7:1-24 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/7/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis7]]
>  <sup> **1** </sup>The Lord then said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation. <sup> **2** </sup>Take with you seven of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and two of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate, <sup> **3** </sup>and also seven of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth. <sup> **4** </sup>Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made.” <sup> **5** </sup>And Noah did all that the Lord commanded him. <sup> **6** </sup>Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth. <sup> **7** </sup>And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood. <sup> **8** </sup>Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground, <sup> **9** </sup>male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah. <sup> **10** </sup>And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth. <sup> **11** </sup>In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month—on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened. <sup> **12** </sup>And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights. <sup> **13** </sup>On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark. <sup> **14** </sup>They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings. <sup> **15** </sup>Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark. <sup> **16** </sup>The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the Lord shut him in. <sup> **17** </sup>For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth. <sup> **18** </sup>The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water. <sup> **19** </sup>They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered. <sup> **20** </sup>The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet. <sup> **21** </sup>Every living thing that moved on the earth perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind. <sup> **22** </sup>Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died. <sup> **23** </sup>Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; men and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds of the air were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark. <sup> **24** </sup>The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days.

> [!Bible]- [Genesis 8:1-22 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/8/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis8]]
>  <sup> **1** </sup>But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded. <sup> **2** </sup>Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky. <sup> **3** </sup>The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down, <sup> **4** </sup>and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. <sup> **5** </sup>The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible. <sup> **6** </sup>After forty days Noah opened the window he had made in the ark <sup> **7** </sup>and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth. <sup> **8** </sup>Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground. <sup> **9** </sup>But the dove could find no place to set its feet because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark. <sup> **10** </sup>He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark. <sup> **11** </sup>When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth. <sup> **12** </sup>He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him. <sup> **13** </sup>By the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry. <sup> **14** </sup>By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry. <sup> **15** </sup>Then God said to Noah, <sup> **16** </sup>“Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives. <sup> **17** </sup>Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you—the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground—so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number upon it.” <sup> **18** </sup>So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives. <sup> **19** </sup>All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds—everything that moves on the earth—came out of the ark, one kind after another. <sup> **20** </sup>Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it. <sup> **21** </sup>The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: “Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done. <sup> **22** </sup>“As long as the earth endures,<br/>seedtime and harvest,<br/>cold and heat,<br/>summer and winter,<br/>day and night<br/>will never cease.”


### Parallels:
#### Name:
Right off the bat, Noah is named [[Rest]].  [[Jesus]] says,
> [!Bible]- [Matthew 11:28 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/40/11/) [[Matthew]] [[Matthew11]]
>  <sup> **28** </sup>“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.

#### The Cross and the Door:
[[God]] tells Noah that judgment is coming and that he is to save humanity by building a vessel of [[wood]]. Sounds very similar to the [[cross]]. 

The ark itself also only had one [[door]]. Jesus refers to himself as the door. 
> [!Bible]- [John 10:9 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/43/10/) [[John]] [[John10]]
>  <sup> **9** </sup>I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. He will come in and go out, and find pasture.

#### Pitch and Atonement:
God tells Noah to cover the ark with [[pitch]] which is the same word as [[atonement]].
> [!Bible]- [Genesis 6:14 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/6/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis6]]
>  <sup> **14** </sup>So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with **pitch** inside and out.

The same word is used in Leviticus with regards to sacrifices:
> [!Bible]- [Leviticus 17:11 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/3/17/) [[Leviticus]] [[Leviticus17]]
>  <sup> **11** </sup>For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make **atonement** for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one’s life.

So this vessel of wood is waterproofed with pitch which literally also translates to atonement or covering, keeping the [[Chaos Waters]] of judgment out. The ark is atoned inside and out so that those inside are protected from the judgment for man’s sin.

> [!Bible]- [Romans 5:9 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/45/5/) [[Romans]] [[Romans5]]
>  <sup> **9** </sup>Since we have now been justified by his **blood**, how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath through him!

#### Cleansing Water:
The [[water]] represents [[cleansing]]. As the water washes over the earth, it creates a [[new creation]]. Jesus calls himself “living water.”l in
> [!Bible]- [Titus 3:4-6 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/56/3/) [[Titus]] [[Titus3]]
>  <sup> **4** </sup>But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, <sup> **5** </sup>he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, <sup> **6** </sup>whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior,

When we are washed by the living water, we become a new creation. 
> [!Bible]- [2Corinthians 5:17 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/47/5/) [[2Corinthians]] [[2Corinthians5]]
>  <sup> **17** </sup>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!

#### Baptism:
The water also symbolizes [[baptism]]. Peter makes this connection in 
> [!Bible]- [1Peter 3:19-22 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/60/3/) [[1Peter]] [[1Peter3]]
>  <sup> **19** </sup>through whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison <sup> **20** </sup>who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of **Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water**, <sup> **21** </sup>and this water symbolizes **baptism** that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, <sup> **22** </sup>who has gone into heaven and is at God’s right hand—with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.

#### Symbolic Numbers:

**8:** [[8]] people were saved. If [[7]] is represents the completion or finality of something, 8, being one number further, represents a new creation or new beginning. 

The start of the Holy Week is [[Palm Sunday]] and the end of it was [[resurrection]] day. If you count from the start of the week, you’ll find that Jesus raised from the dead on the 8th day.

**40:** It rained for 40 days and 40 nights. 
> [!Bible]- [Genesis 7:12 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/7/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis7]]
>  <sup> **12** </sup>And rain fell on the earth **forty days and forty nights.**

[[40]] represents a period of trial or waiting. 

#### Landing on Ararat:
The story tells us they landed on the mountains of [[Ararat]] on the **17th day of the 7th month.**

> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 8:1-4 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/8/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis8]]
>  <sup> **1** </sup>But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded. <sup> **2** </sup>Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky. <sup> **3** </sup>The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down, <sup> **4** </sup>and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.

Why is this significant? The Jews used a different calendar than we do. Their year starts in the springtime, in April. This calendar started with the first Passover in Egypt

> [!Bible]- [Exodus 12:1-2 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/2/12/) [[Exodus]] [[Exodus12]]
>  <sup> **1** </sup>The Passover<br/>The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt, <sup> **2** </sup>“This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year.

Before the Hebrew calendar was instituted, their calendar would’ve been the Canaanite calendar where the first month began in October

***If you assume that the biblical author was accounting for that when saying what month it was, then that means that the 17th day of the 7th month was actually the 17th day of the 1st month of the Hebrew calendar.***

The 14th day of the 1st month was Passover - the day Jesus died...which makes **the 17th day of the first month, the day Jesus raised from the dead, defeating the curse.**

Not only that, but the Ark landed on the mountains of Ararat. 

Ararat translates to “The [[Curse]] is Reversed”. 

So on the same day that Jesus later would be raised from the dead, completing the reversal of the curse, the ark, representing Jesus’ death on the cross, lands on the mountains whose name means “the curse is reversed”.

#### Birds:
> [!Bible]- [Genesis 8:6-12 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/8/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis8]]
>  <sup> **6** </sup>After forty days Noah opened the window he had made in the ark <sup> **7** </sup>and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth. <sup> **8** </sup>Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground. <sup> **9** </sup>But the dove could find no place to set its feet because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark. <sup> **10** </sup>He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark. <sup> **11** </sup>When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth. <sup> **12** </sup>He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.

A [[Raven]] is released first. A raven is a scavenger bird that would land on any carcass to feed.

A [[Raven]] is released first. A raven is a scavenger bird that would land on any carcass to feed.

In this story, I believe the raven symbolizes a sinner who is content with the things of this world apart from Christ.

Potentially even represents Satan who the Bible says in 
> [!Bible]- [Job 1:7 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/18/1/) [[Job]] [[Job1]]
>  <sup> **7** </sup>The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”<br/>Satan answered the Lord, “From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it.”

A [[dove]] is released next. In scripture the dove represents the [[Holy Spirit]] which comes after Jesus left earth. The dove returns with an olive branch. 

The [[olive tree]] represents [[peace]]. The dove bringing a fresh olive leaf is symbolic of God making peace with man after the judgment has passed.

The olive tree also represents the Holy Spirit. Olive oil was used in the sacrificial system as the carrier for the spices in the holy anointing oil which was used to make things [[Holy]].

Whenever the Holy Spirit’s presence comes upon someone in the New Testament it is described as an anointing. 
> [!Bible]- [Luke 4:18 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/42/4/) [[Luke]] [[Luke4]]
>  <sup> **18** </sup>“The Spirit of the Lord is on me,<br/>because he has anointed me<br/>to preach good news to the poor.<br/>He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners<br/>and recovery of sight for the blind,<br/>to release the oppressed

> [!Bible]- [Acts 10:38 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/44/10/) [[Acts]] [[Acts10]]
>  <sup> **38** </sup>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.

The process by which olives are beaten and crushed to produce olive oil contains spiritual significance as well.
    

Jesus Christ was beaten and crushed on the cross so that His Holy Spirit would be poured out on the church after His ascension to heaven.

In essence, Jesus Christ is God’s olive tree, and the Holy Spirit, His olive oil.

It is not mere coincidence that Christ’s agonized prayer, just before His arrest, occured in [[Gethsemane]], a place of many olive trees and whose name means “olive press.”

The olive tree is unique in that it can grow leaves under water.
    
With the dove returning with an olive leaf, that means that the leaf was no longer under water and could be plucked by the dove and brought to Noah.
    
Just as an olive tree can grow out from underneath the water, so Christ rose from the dead. Here we have a picture of baptism

Here, we see the dove, representing the Holy Spirit, bringing an olive branch that had been baptized by the flood, filled with symbolism, to Noah.

This symbolism comes to a head in Jesus’ baptism.

> [!Bible]- [Mark 1:9-11 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/41/1/) [[Mark]] [[Mark1]]
>  <sup> **9** </sup>The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus<br/>At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. <sup> **10** </sup>As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. <sup> **11** </sup>And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”
