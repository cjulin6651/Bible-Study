### Note:
While the Bible doesn't explicitly take this stance (there are hints), when studying the Rephaim, it is import to understand the cultural beliefs surrounding them as it can bring clarity to a number of passages in scripture surrounding them.

Giants first show up on the scene in Genesis 6.

>  <sup> **4** </sup>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.

This first says "the Nephilim were on the earth in those days -  *and also afterward*." The Nephilim were the giants created as a result of spiritual rebellion. They were the half-blood giants, spawn of spiritual beings called [[the sons of God]] and human women.  The question that has been asked by scholars for many many years is "how did the Nephilim survive the flood." Obviously Moses is the one writing the book post flood so this "and also afterward" note is meant to make you realize that the giants in the land were nephilim. Was there another spiritual rebellion not mentioned in scripture? 

Jewish tradition believed that the souls of the Nephilim were different because they were half human and half spiritual being. They didn't just die in the flood, but rather the souls lived on and became what we know as demons or evil spirits.

See the following quotes from the Book. of Enoch and the Book of Jubilees (these are not scripture, but they are very useful in determining the cultural significance.)

**1 Enoch 15:8-10**
Now the giants, who lave been born of spirit and of flesh, shall be called upon earth evil spirits, and on earth shall be their habitation. Evil spirits shall proceed from their flesh, because they were created from above; from the holy Watchers was their beginning and primary foundation. Evil spirits shall they be upon earth, and the spirits of the wicked shall they be called. The habitation of the spirits of heaven shall be in heaven; but upon earth shall be the habitation of terrestrial spirits, who are born on earth.
The spirits of the giants shall be like clouds, which shall oppress, corrupt, fall, contend, and bruise upon earth.

They shall cause lamentation. No food shall they eat; and they shall be thirsty; they shall be concealed, and shall not 1 rise up against the sons of men, and against women; for they come forth during the days of slaughter and destruction.

**Jubiliees 10:2-9**
And the sons of Noah came to Noah their father, and they told him concerning the demons which were leading astray and blinding and slaying his sons' sons.
And he prayed before the Lord his God, and said:
'God of the spirits of all flesh, who hast shown mercy unto me
And hast saved me and my sons from the waters of the flood,
And hast not caused me to perish as Thou didst the sons of perdition;

For Thy grace has been great towards me,
And great has been Thy mercy to my soul;

Let Thy grace be lift up upon my sons,
And let not wicked spirits rule over them
Lest they should destroy them from the earth.

But do Thou bless me and my sons, that we may increase and Multiply and replenish the earth.

And Thou knowest how Thy Watchers, the fathers of these spirits, acted in my day: and as for these spirits which are living, imprison them and hold them fast in the place of condemnation, and let them not bring destruction on the sons of thy servant, my God; for these are malignant, and created in order to destroy.

And let them not rule over the spirits of the living; for Thou alone canst exercise dominion over them. And let them not have power over the sons of the righteous from henceforth and for evermore.'
And the Lord our God bade us to bind all.

And the chief of the spirits, Mastêmâ, came and said: 'Lord, Creator, let some of them remain before me, and let them harken to my voice, and do all that I shall say unto them; for if some of them are not left to me, I shall not be able to execute the power of my will on the sons of men; for these are for corruption and leading astray before my judgment, for great is the wickedness of the sons of men.'

And He said: Let the tenth part of them remain before him, and let nine parts descend into the place of condemnation.'

This belief that the Rephaim became wandering spirits would explain why the Bible sometimes refers to them as giants and sometimes refers to them as evil spirits trapped in [[Sheol]].  The Canaanites believed that the giants were people who had been possessed by a god and would worship them. At the top of ancient ziggurats, you would sometimes find giant beds. Plans for the Ziggurat of Etemenanki (possibly the Tower of Babel) show a bed for the god Marduk at the top. Interestingly, this bed’s dimensions are given on the Esagil tablet and it says “The bed: 9 cubits the length, 4 cubits the breadth” (See [translation](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/btto/Q007970)). This is the same size as the bed of [[Og King of Bashan]] found in Deuteronomy.

> [!Bible]+ [Deuteronomy 3:11 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/5/3/) [[Deuteronomy]] [[Deuteronomy3]]
>  <sup> **11** </sup>(Only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaites. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)

This likely means that they believed Og to be the incarnation of the god Marduk.
