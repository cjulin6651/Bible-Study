### Notes
After sinning by eating of a fruit tree, the curse is given and the first prophecy of [[The Messiah]] is given in vs. 15 where a promise that the woman's offspring would crush the serpent. Only the word offspring isn't used, it is "seed". Just as [[The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil]] planted a seed of sin in humanity, so the seed of the woman would one day save humanity by becoming [[The Tree of Life]] and thus plant the seed of the Tree of Life in the hearts of believers so they too can bear fruit and spread the Tree of Life across the earth, being fruitful and multiplying believers.
