### Important Characters
The one who meditates on God's word.

### Passage:
> [!Bible]+ [Psalm 1:1-3 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/19/1/) [[Psalms]]
>  <sup> **1** </sup>BOOK I<br/>Psalms 1â€“41<br/>Psalm 1<br/>Blessed is the man<br/>who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked<br/>or stand in the way of sinners<br/>or sit in the seat of mockers. <sup> **2** </sup>But his delight is in the law of the Lord,<br/>and on his law he meditates day and night. <sup> **3** </sup>He is like a tree planted by streams of water,<br/>which yields its fruit in season<br/>and whose leaf does not wither.<br/>Whatever he does prospers.
 %% %%

### Notes
[[David]] reflects on the person who meditates on God's word as like a strong tree rooted by a river. This brings imagery of [[The Tree of Life]] planted in the [[Garden of Eden]] with the river running through it.

> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 2:10 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/2/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis2]]
>  <sup> **10** </sup>A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters.
 %% %%
