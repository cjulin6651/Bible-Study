>  <sup> **27** </sup>So God created man in his own image,<br/>in the image of God he created him;<br/>male and female he created them. <sup> **28** </sup>God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.” <sup> **29** </sup>Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it.

### Notes
God gives the land the command to produce plants and trees and for those trees to spread their seed across the earth. It specifies fruit trees from among them.

God then, from the earth, also creates humans with the command to be fruitful (like fruit trees) and multiply across the earth.
