### Passage:
> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 11:3-4 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/11/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis11]]
>  <sup> **3** </sup>They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. <sup> **4** </sup>Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”
 %% %%

### Notes
The language "Come let us make" matches the general language of God as He speaks to the in Genesis 1

> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 1:26 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/1/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis1]]
>  <sup> **26** </sup>Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”

Interesting to note that man was made from [[dust]] as are bricks. This story also represents man's attempt to recreate the [[Garden of Eden]]. Eden was a mountain garden where Heaven and Earth connected as we see in Ezekiel 28.
> [!Bible]- [Ezekiel 28:14 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/26/28/) [[Ezekiel]] [[Ezekiel28]]
