### Passage:
> [!bible]+ [Genesis 15:1-21 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/15/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis15]]
>  <sup> **1** </sup>God’s Covenant With Abram<br/>After this, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision:<br/>“Do not be afraid, Abram.<br/>I am your shield,<br/>your very great reward.” <sup> **2** </sup>But Abram said, “O Sovereign Lord, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?” <sup> **3** </sup>And Abram said, “You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.” <sup> **4** </sup>Then the word of the Lord came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but a son coming from your own body will be your heir.” <sup> **5** </sup>He took him outside and said, “Look up at the heavens and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.” <sup> **6** </sup>Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness. <sup> **7** </sup>He also said to him, “I am the Lord, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.” <sup> **8** </sup>But Abram said, “O Sovereign Lord, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?” <sup> **9** </sup>So the Lord said to him, “Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.” <sup> **10** </sup>Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half. <sup> **11** </sup>Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. <sup> **12** </sup>As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him. <sup> **13** </sup>Then the Lord said to him, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years. <sup> **14** </sup>But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions. <sup> **15** </sup>You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a good old age. <sup> **16** </sup>In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.” <sup> **17** </sup>When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces. <sup> **18** </sup>On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates— <sup> **19** </sup>the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, <sup> **20** </sup>Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, <sup> **21** </sup>Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.”

### Notes
In this chapter, Yahweh forms a covenant with Abram. There are several cultural things going on in this strange story that take it from macabre to beautiful. 

In ancient covenants, there was often a more powerful party (suzerain) who formed a covenant with a lesser party (the vassal). Each party would list out their terms with each other. Typically the vassal would have a list of duties far longer than the suzerain, but the suzerain would offer protection or something along those lines.

The second cultural element that took place during ancient covenants is that there would be a covenant sacrifice. Usually an animal or series of animals would be cut down the middle from head to tail and the bloody halves would be laid on either side of the covenant makers, creating a bloody path. Both the suzerain and the vassal would walk between the bloody animal parts to demonstrate what would happen to them if either party broke the covenant.

The Abrahamic Covenant, however, has a couple of key differences from the standard ancient covenant. First, rather than the list of duties for [[Abraham|Abram]] (the vassal) being far longer, all Abram has to do is believe in Yahweh's promises. Yahweh (the suzerain), however, promises land and protection for Abram's descendants.

The second major difference is that, rather than both parties walking the bloody path together, Yahweh suddenly causes a [[deep sleep]] to fall on Abram. Suddenly, Abram cannot walk the path, but instead watches in a vision as God walks the path in the form of a torch and a smoking oven. Rather than Abram bear the consequences of a broken covenant, Yahweh Himself, promises to die before letting the covenant with Abram be broken, which, as we know from scripture, is exactly what happens with [[Jesus]].

#### Other notes:
The [[deep sleep ]]that falls on Abram is the same deep sleep that falls on [[Adam]] as [[Eve]] is created. Rather than split animals, we see Adam himself is split down the middle as Eve is created from his side. In the Abrahamic Covenant, God is forming for himself a helper ([[ezer]]) (the nation of [[Israel]]) through whom He will partner with to bless all nations.

There is also definitely a connection to the Red Sea crossing where the waters are split and a pillar of smoke and fire passes through the waters as the nation of Israel is born.
