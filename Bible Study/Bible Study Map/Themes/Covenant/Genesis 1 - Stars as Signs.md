### Passage:
InsertPassageHere> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 1:14 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/1/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis1]]
>  <sup> **14** </sup>And God said, â€œLet there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as ***signs*** to mark seasons and days and years,
 %% %%

### Notes
The first use of [[H226]] in Scripture. The usage of this word for [[signs]] The stars are to be used for signs. Seems odd for stars to be used as covenantal signs...until you think about [[Abraham]] when God uses stars as a promise of what Abraham's descendants would be like. 

> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 26:4 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/26/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis26]]
>  <sup> **4** </sup>I will make your descendants as numerous as the ***stars*** in the sky and will give them all these lands, and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed,
 %% %%

God also promised Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the [[dust]] on the ground.

> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 13:16 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/13/)
>  <sup> **16** </sup>I will make your offspring like ***the dust*** of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted.
 %% %%

As mentioned in [[Genesis 13 - Lot saw the land]], this is somewhat of a reversal of a curse, but we see it come together when the book of [[Daniel]] discusses [[the Rapture]]. 

> [!Bible]+ [Daniel 12:2-3 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/27/12/) [[Daniel]] [[Daniel12]]
>  <sup> **2** </sup>Multitudes ***who sleep in the dust of the earth*** will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt. <sup> **3** </sup>Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, ***like the stars*** for ever and ever.
 %% %%

God's covenantal people who are both more numerous than and rest in the dust of the earth will be caught up and resurrected to be made like the stars. We see these promises of God come full circle in [[Daniel]] and [[Revelation]], but the theme begins and is foreshadowed in [[Genesis1]] when God establishes the stars as [[sign]]s.
