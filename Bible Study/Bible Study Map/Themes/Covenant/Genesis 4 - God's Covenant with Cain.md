[[Cain]]

### Passage:
> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 4:13-15 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/4/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis4]]
>  <sup> **13** </sup>Cain said to the Lord, ***“My punishment is more than I can bear.*** <sup> **14** </sup>Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” <sup> **15** </sup>But the Lord said to him, “Not so; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the Lord put a ***mark*** on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.
 %% %%

### Notes
Here we see a foreshadowing of [[grace]] and [[the gospel]]. Cain says that the punishment for his [[sin]] is greater than he can bear because everyone will want to kill him. 

We too face a punishment greater than we can bear for our own sin.

> [!Bible]+ [Psalm 49:7-9 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/19/49/) [[Psalms]] [[Psalm49]]
>  <sup> **7** </sup>No man can redeem the life of another<br/>or give to God a ransom for him— <sup> **8** </sup>the ransom for a life is costly,<br/>no payment is ever enough— <sup> **9** </sup>that he should live on forever<br/>and not see decay.

> [!Bible]+ [Romans 6:23 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/45/6/) [[Romans]] [[Romans6]]
>  <sup> **23** </sup>For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Instead of allowing him to die, God gives him a [[sign]] to set him apart. Anyone who harms him will be cursed 70 times. The word for sign is often used alongside covenantal language. "This shall be a sign to you".
