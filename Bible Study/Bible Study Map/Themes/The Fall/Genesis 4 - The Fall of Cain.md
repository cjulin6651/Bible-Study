### Passage:
> [!Bible]- [Genesis 4:1-17 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/4/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis4]]
>  <sup> **1** </sup>Cain and Abel<br/>Adam lay with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, “With the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man.” <sup> **2** </sup>Later she gave birth to his brother Abel.<br/>Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. <sup> **3** </sup>In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord. <sup> **4** </sup>But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering, <sup> **5** </sup>but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast. <sup> **6** </sup>Then the Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? <sup> **7** </sup>If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it.” <sup> **8** </sup>Now Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.” And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. <sup> **9** </sup>Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?”<br/>“I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s keeper?” <sup> **10** </sup>The Lord said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground. <sup> **11** </sup>Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. <sup> **12** </sup>When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.” <sup> **13** </sup>Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment is more than I can bear. <sup> **14** </sup>Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” <sup> **15** </sup>But the Lord said to him, “Not so; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. <sup> **16** </sup>So Cain went out from the Lord’s presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden. <sup> **17** </sup>Cain lay with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.

### Notes
Cain falls because of a fruit. He is the embodiment of the curse because he is one who “Toils the Ground”. He is given a choice ([[The Test]]) and chooses to kill his brother, sending him back to the dust where his blood cries out. His curse is that the ground wouldn’t yield him more fruit (a ground related curse). He is exiled to [[The East]]  where he “knows his wife” just as [[Adam]] did [[Eve]], after the fall. 

This chapter shows humanities descent into sin because [[Lamech]] takes 2 wives rather than one and kills a man but brags about how his sin was 7 times as bad as Cain’s.
