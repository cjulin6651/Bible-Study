### Passage:
> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 11:1-9 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/11/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis11]]
>  <sup> **1** </sup>The Tower of Babel<br/>Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. <sup> **2** </sup>As men moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there. <sup> **3** </sup>They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. <sup> **4** </sup>Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.” <sup> **5** </sup>But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building. <sup> **6** </sup>The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. <sup> **7** </sup>Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.” <sup> **8** </sup>So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. <sup> **9** </sup>That is why it was called Babel—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.

### Notes
We are told in verse 2 that they were "moving from the east." Possibly indicating mankind's move into sin. What this leads to is the rebellion through the building of the[[Tower of Babel]].
