>  <sup> **20** </sup>Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it—it is very small, isn’t it? Then my life will be spared.” <sup> **21** </sup>He said to him, “Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of. <sup> **22** </sup>But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.” (That is why the town was called Zoar.) <sup> **23** </sup>By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land. <sup> **24** </sup>Then the Lord rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the Lord out of the heavens. <sup> **25** </sup>Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities—and also the vegetation in the land. <sup> **26** </sup>But Lot’s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. <sup> **27** </sup>Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the Lord. <sup> **28** </sup>He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace. <sup> **29** </sup>So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived. <sup> **30** </sup>Lot and His Daughters<br/>Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave.
