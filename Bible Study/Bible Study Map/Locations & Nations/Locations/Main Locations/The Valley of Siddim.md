>  <sup> **2** </sup>went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). <sup> **3** </sup>All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (the Salt Sea). <sup> **4** </sup>For twelve years they had been subject to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. <sup> **5** </sup>In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim <sup> **6** </sup>and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert. <sup> **7** </sup>Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazazon Tamar. <sup> **8** </sup>Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and drew up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim <sup> **9** </sup>against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasarâ€”four kings against five. <sup> **10** </sup>Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of the men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills.
