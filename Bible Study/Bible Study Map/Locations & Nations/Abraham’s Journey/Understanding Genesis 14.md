## Babylonian Campaign
Defeated [[Rephaim]] in Ashteroth Karnaim
[[Zuzim]] in Ham
[[Emim]] in Shaveh-kiriathaim
Horites in their Mt. Seir as far as El-paran
[[Amalekites]] in En-mishpat (Kadesh)
[[Amorites]] in Hazazon-tamar 

Essentially the Babylonians made a giant U shape starting north east of The Valley of Siddim, circling down towards the Sinai Peninsula, then heading up through the Negev to the west side of the dead sea before meeting the Southern Kings in the Valley of Siddim for battle.

They fight and the southern kings lose. In fleeing the battle, many of them fall in the asphalt/bitumin pits. Meanwhile the Babylonian kings kidnap Lot and plunder him and the defeated cities before heading north. 

Interestingly, the word for asphalt is also translated [[bitumin]]. It is only used 2 other times in the Bible. The first time it is used is when the [[Tower of Babel]] is being built.

> [!bible]+ [Genesis 11:3 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/11/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis11]]
>  <sup> **3** </sup>They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and **tar** for mortar.

The third occasion is when Moses' ark is covered in pitch and bitumin. 

> [!bible]+ [Exodus 2:3 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/2/2/) [[Exodus]] [[Exodus2]]
>  <sup> **3** </sup>But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.

I believe there is certainly a connection here, but I'm not sure what it is. Perhaps a connection between the sins of Babel connected to the Kings of Sodom and Gomorrah? Perhaps a connection to the fact that Babylon is causing the scattering of nations again here?
