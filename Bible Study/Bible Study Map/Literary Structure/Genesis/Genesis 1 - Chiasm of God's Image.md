### Passage:
> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 1:26-28 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/1/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis1]]
>  <sup> **26** </sup>Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.” <sup> **27** </sup>So God created man in his own image,<br/>in the image of God he created him;<br/>male and female he created them. <sup> **28** </sup>God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”
 %% %%

### Notes:
This chiasm points to a crucial part of [[The Image of God]] and an important aspect of His nature being to "rule." This aspect of God's nature is passed down to humans.

The peek of the [[chiasm]] is God creating human and then dividing them into male and female. This indicates an element of God's nature that is somehow expressed in the duality of gender.
