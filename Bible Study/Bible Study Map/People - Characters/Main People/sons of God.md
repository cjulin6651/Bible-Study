>  <sup> **1** </sup>The Flood<br/>When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, <sup> **2** </sup>the **sons of God** saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. <sup> **3** </sup>Then the Lord said, “My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days will be a hundred and twenty years.” <sup> **4** </sup>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown. <sup> **5** </sup>The Lord saw how great man’s wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time. <sup> **6** </sup>The Lord was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain. <sup> **7** </sup>So the Lord said, “I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth—men and animals, and creatures that move along the ground, and birds of the air—for I am grieved that I have made them.” <sup> **8** </sup>But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.

This rebellion is potentially an attempt by the rebellion to restore the [[Garden of Eden]] to mankind...the merging of the spiritual realm with the earthly realm.

Many argue that the sons of God were not heavenly beings, rather the Godly sons of Adam’s son Seth who married bad women. This doesn't make sense in the context of [[The Divine Council]].

Jude and 2 Peter reference the rebellion.

>  <sup> **6** </sup>**And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their own home?**—these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day. <sup> **7** </sup>In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.

>  <sup> **4** </sup>For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them into gloomy dungeons to be held for judgment; <sup> **5** </sup>if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others; <sup> **6** </sup>if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; <sup> **7** </sup>and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men <sup> **8** </sup>(for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)— <sup> **9** </sup>if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment, while continuing their punishment. <sup> **10** </sup>This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the sinful nature and despise authority.<br/>Bold and arrogant, these men are not afraid to slander celestial beings;
