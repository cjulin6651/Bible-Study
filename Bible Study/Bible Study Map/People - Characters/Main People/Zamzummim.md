### General Description:
Another name for the [[Rephaim]].

Possibly one of the nations ([[Zuzim]])defeated by Chedorlaomer in Genesis 14. Listed alongside of additional groups known to have been the [[Rephaim]]. They are only mentioned in this verse, though so it isn't certain they were a group of giants. Scholars point out the similarity to the name of the Zamzummim.

See this interesting quote from the following [website](https://www.hebrewversity.com/rephaim-emim-zamzummim-hebrew-meaning-mysterious-ancient-nation-giants/):
"*Zamzummim (זמזומים) comes from the Hebrew word Zimzum (זמזום) which means ‘buzz’ or ‘hum’ and describes the characteristic noise they produced which is strongly associated with the ancient belief of the noise the spirits of the dead generated, as can be found in the Book of Isaiah:

*“And when they say to you, “Inquire of the mediums and the necromancers who chirp and mutter,” should not a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of the dead on behalf of the living?” (Isaiah 8:19)*

*Another captivating explanation for this name is based on the unique morphology of the Hebrew word Zimzum -which is an onomatopoeia – a word that phonetically imitates the source of the sound that it describes.*

*When one thinks about it also the English translation of this word ‘buzzing’ also imitates the production of the sound it is describing. In other words, the sound of the Rephaim’s language sounded to the Ammonites as buzzing and is similar to what happened with the ancient Greeks who called the primitive tribes of Europe “barbarians” – because of the sound of their language.*"*
