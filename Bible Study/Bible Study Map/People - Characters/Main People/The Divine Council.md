### General Description:
God’s staff team mentioned briefly here and there throughout scripture. Seem to be composed of elevated spiritual beings called the [[sons of God]] Maybe angels, maybe something more. Whether the full council rebelled against God or just some of them is unclear, but the fallen members proceed to take on the roles of pagan deities throughout scripture.
