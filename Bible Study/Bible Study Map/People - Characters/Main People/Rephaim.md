### General Description:
The giants found in the land of [[Canaan]]. They went by many names (see above). The term is also used to refer to the spirits of the dead once all the Rephaim have been killed.

### Biblical Context:
While the Bible doesn't explicitly take this stance (there are hints at least to cultural beliefs), when studying the Rephaim, it is import to understand the cultural beliefs surrounding them as it can bring clarity to a number of passages in scripture surrounding them.

Giants first show up on the scene in Genesis 6.

> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 6:4 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/6/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis6]]
>  <sup> **4** </sup>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.
 %% %%

This first says "the Nephilim were on the earth in those days -  *and also afterward*." The Nephilim were the giants created as a result of spiritual rebellion. They were the half-blood giants, spawn of spiritual beings called the [[sons of God]] and human women.  The question that has been asked by scholars for many many years is "how did the Nephilim survive the flood." Obviously Moses is the one writing the book post flood so this "and also afterward" note is meant to make you realize that the giants in the land were nephilim. Was there another spiritual rebellion not mentioned in scripture? 

They appear on the scene post flood for the first time in Genesis 14.

> [!Bible]+ [Genesis 14:5 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/14/) [[Genesis]] [[Genesis14]]
>  <sup> **5** </sup>In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim
 %% %%

Elsewhere in scripture, the same root word, "[[râphâ']]" is used for the word "dead" or "shades". Sometimes they are referred to as slain kings.

> [!Bible]+ [Isaiah 14:9 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/23/14/) [[Isaiah]] [[Isaiah14]]
>  <sup> **9** </sup>The grave below is all astir<br/>to meet you at your coming;<br/>it rouses the **spirits** (râphâ') of the departed to greet you—<br/>all those who were leaders in the world;<br/>it makes them rise from their thrones—<br/>all those who were kings over the nations.

### Cultural Context:
Jewish tradition believed that the souls of the Nephilim were different because they were half human and half spiritual being. They didn't just die in the flood, but rather the souls lived on and became what we know as demons or evil spirits.

See the following quotes from the [[Book of Enoch]] and the Book of Jubilees (these are not scripture, but they are very useful in determining the cultural significance.)

**1 Enoch 15:8-10**
Now the giants, who lave been born of spirit and of flesh, shall be called upon earth evil spirits, and on earth shall be their habitation. Evil spirits shall proceed from their flesh, because they were created from above; from the holy Watchers was their beginning and primary foundation. Evil spirits shall they be upon earth, and the spirits of the wicked shall they be called. The habitation of the spirits of heaven shall be in heaven; but upon earth shall be the habitation of terrestrial spirits, who are born on earth.
The spirits of the giants shall be like clouds, which shall oppress, corrupt, fall, contend, and bruise upon earth.

They shall cause lamentation. No food shall they eat; and they shall be thirsty; they shall be concealed, and shall not 1 rise up against the sons of men, and against women; for they come forth during the days of slaughter and destruction.

**Jubiliees 10:2-9**
And the sons of Noah came to Noah their father, and they told him concerning the demons which were leading astray and blinding and slaying his sons' sons.
And he prayed before the Lord his God, and said:
'God of the spirits of all flesh, who hast shown mercy unto me
And hast saved me and my sons from the waters of the flood,
And hast not caused me to perish as Thou didst the sons of perdition;

For Thy grace has been great towards me,
And great has been Thy mercy to my soul;

Let Thy grace be lift up upon my sons,
And let not wicked spirits rule over them
Lest they should destroy them from the earth.

But do Thou bless me and my sons, that we may increase and Multiply and replenish the earth.

And Thou knowest how Thy Watchers, the fathers of these spirits, acted in my day: and as for these spirits which are living, imprison them and hold them fast in the place of condemnation, and let them not bring destruction on the sons of thy servant, my God; for these are malignant, and created in order to destroy.

And let them not rule over the spirits of the living; for Thou alone canst exercise dominion over them. And let them not have power over the sons of the righteous from henceforth and for evermore.'
And the Lord our God bade us to bind all.

And the chief of the spirits, Mastêmâ, came and said: 'Lord, Creator, let some of them remain before me, and let them harken to my voice, and do all that I shall say unto them; for if some of them are not left to me, I shall not be able to execute the power of my will on the sons of men; for these are for corruption and leading astray before my judgment, for great is the wickedness of the sons of men.'

And He said: Let the tenth part of them remain before him, and let nine parts descend into the place of condemnation.'

--

This belief that the Rephaim became wandering spirits would explain why the Bible sometimes refers to them as giants and sometimes refers to them as evil spirits trapped in [[Sheol]].  The Canaanites believed that the giants were people who had been possessed by a god and would worship them. At the top of ancient ziggurats, you would sometimes find giant beds. Plans for the Ziggurat of Etemenanki (possibly the Tower of Babel) show a bed for the god Marduk at the top. Interestingly, this bed’s dimensions are given on the Esagil tablet and it says “The bed: 9 cubits the length, 4 cubits the breadth” (See [translation](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/btto/Q007970)). This is the same size as the bed of [[Og]] King of [[Bashan]] found in Deuteronomy.

> [!Bible]+ [Deuteronomy 3:11 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/5/3/) [[Deuteronomy]] [[Deuteronomy3]]
>  <sup> **11** </sup>(Only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaites. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)
 %% %%

This likely means that they believed Og to be the incarnation of the god Marduk.

### Summary:
Whether the Rephaim were the spirits of the [[Nephilim]] who possessed people, creating giants or not is not something the Bible takes a stance on, but several things are undeniable.

1) The word "Rephaim" is used both to describe giants and the spirits of the dead.
2) The Babylonians, Canaanites, and other local people groups believed the giants were the spirits of the gods come down to possess and empower their kings and heroes. 

One interesting fact is that the greek word used in the new testament for [[demon]] is [[daimōn]]. This word is the exact same word used in Greek mythology for demigod (the name for mythological heroes of old who were half god half human).

### Transfiguration of Jesus and the Rephaim:
In [[The Transfiguration]] account, Jesus goes to visit a mountain. This is most likely [[Mount Hermon]] since he was just in [[Caesarea Philippi]] which is at the base of Mt. Hermon. Mt. Hermon is the tallest mountain in Israel, and we are told they went up a “high mountain”.

Mt. Hermon marks the northernmost boundary of The Promised Land. Often-times, mountains in the region were considered to be holy sites of worship for Canaanite deities. The higher the mountain, the more sacred the Canaanites believed it to be. This meant that Mt. Hermon was considered to be the most sacred mountain. In fact, the name Mt. Hermon comes from the name Baal Hermon.  This likely was the name of the chief deity worshipped there, but also was the name of the city at the foot of the mountain.

Baal-Hermon comes from Baal - Lord and Haram which means to designate someone to the afterlife. So it literally means Lord of Designation

Archaeologists have found over 30 little shrines and temples scattered all across the mountain. Many of these [temples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temples_of_Mount_Hermon#:~:text=The%20Temples%20of%20Mount%20Hermon%20in%20Taylor's%20second%20group%20included,Mejdal%20Anjar%2C%20Mdoukha%20and%20Bakka.) were then rebuilt by the Greeks and Romans and rededicated to their gods. Many of those ruins are what stand today.

A portion of the Epic of Gilgamesh even states, “the dwelling-place of the Anunnaki” (group or council of gods) is in “the Lebanon ranges.” This is the range where Mt. Hermon and Mt. Zaphon (where the Bible said Satan took up residence as Baal) are found.

Mt. Hermon, however, had a more infamous reputation in Jewish culture. It is also known as “The Abode of the Nephilim” Said in [[The Book of Enoch]] to be the site that the sons of God came down to earth and slept with the daughters of man to create the Nephilim...the traditional site of the second rebellion.

The city of Baal Hermon becomes known as Banius.
By this point it has become the center of worship for the god Pan.
The city of Banius held one very unique feature which lent itself to the worship of Pan.

A seemingly bottomless pool of water inside a shallow cave.
Jewish historian Josephus described it this way, “a top of a mountain that is raised to an immense height, and at its side, beneath, or at its bottom, a dark cave opens itself; within which there is a horrible precipice, that descends abruptly to an immeasurable depth: it contains a huge amount of water, which never goes anywhere; and when anybody lets down anything to measure how far down the earth is beneath the water, no length of cord is sufficient to reach it.”

This became known as the Gates of Hades and considered to be the entrance to the underworld. They worshipped Pan here because he was able to go back and forth between the underworld and the land of the living since he was the son of Hermes who ushered the dead (Hermes name is probably derived from Mt. Hermon).

In Jesus’ day, it became known as Caesarea Philippi and a temple had been built there for worship of the god Pan. It was an incredibly immoral city. In the worship of Pan there was major prostitution, goat sacrifice, and sex with goats. It had a reputation worse than Las Vegas for being a sinful place.

> [!Bible]+ [Matthew 16:13-20 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/40/16/) [[Matthew]] [[Matthew16]]
>  <sup> **13** </sup>Peter’s Confession of Christ<br/>When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?” <sup> **14** </sup>They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” <sup> **15** </sup>“But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?” <sup> **16** </sup>Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” <sup> **17** </sup>Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven. <sup> **18** </sup>And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. <sup> **19** </sup>I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” <sup> **20** </sup>Then he warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.
 %% %%

Jesus takes them to the very Gates of Hell in the middle of Sin City and THERE, he is declared as the messiah for the first time. And he tells Peter that the very gates of hell they are standing against won’t withstand the church. That doesn’t mean that hell will not be able to crush the church, but rather the church will storm hell. It is a blatant declaration of war against all the gods and spiritual rebellion. That he doesn’t want Christians to stay away from places like Caesarea Philippi because they are bad but rather come and bring the gospel and love of the church.

In verse 21, he then goes on to say, 

> [!Bible]+ [Matthew 16:21 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/40/16/)
>  <sup> **21** </sup>Jesus Predicts His Death<br/>From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
 %% %%

Standing there, where Jewish tradition says the sons of God came down to earth and fathered the nephilim who’s spirits then returned from the dead to reincarnate, Jesus declares that he, the true son of God must die and rise again in order to defeat death itself.

This leads straight into the next chapter where we get the story of The Transfiguration.

> [!Bible]+ [Matthew 17:1-9 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/40/17/) [[Matthew]] [[Matthew17]]
>  <sup> **1** </sup>The Transfiguration<br/>After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. <sup> **2** </sup>There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. <sup> **3** </sup>Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus. <sup> **4** </sup>Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” <sup> **5** </sup>While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!” <sup> **6** </sup>When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified. <sup> **7** </sup>But Jesus came and touched them. “Get up,” he said. “Don’t be afraid.” <sup> **8** </sup>When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus. <sup> **9** </sup>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, “Don’t tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”
 %% %%

So here, on Mt. Hermon, standing on one of the holiest mountains for pagan worship through all of history, standing among the literal shrines to other gods who rebelled against him, Jesus shows his true deific form and is revealed to be the Messiah as Moses and Elijah appear with him.
Yet again, declaring war, standing smack dab in the middle of the enemy camp.
